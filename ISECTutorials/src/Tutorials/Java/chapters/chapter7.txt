Arrays  

Java provides a data structure, the array, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables.
This tutorial introduces how to declare array variables, create arrays, and process arrays using indexed variables.

Declaring Array Variables
To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −
Syntax
dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.


Note − The style dataType[] arrayRefVar is preferred. The style dataType arrayRefVar[] comes from the C/C++ language and was adopted in Java to accommodate C/C++ programmers.
Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax −
double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.
Creating Arrays
You can create an array by using the new operator with the following syntax −
Syntax
arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];


The above statement does two things −
    It creates an array using new dataType[arraySize].
    It assigns the reference of the newly created array to the variable arrayRefVar.
Declaring an array variable, creating an array, and assigning the reference of the array to the variable can be combined in one statement, as shown below −
dataType[] arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];


Alternatively you can create arrays as follows −
dataType[] arrayRefVar = {value0, value1, ..., valuek};


The array elements are accessed through the index. Array indices are 0-based; that is, they start from 0 to arrayRefVar.length-1.
Example
Following statement declares an array variable, myList, creates an array of 10 elements of double type and assigns its reference to myList −
double[] myList = new double[10];
