Basic Operations

Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −
Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Bitwise Operators
Logical Operators
Assignment Operators
Misc Operators

The Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the arithmetic operators −
Assume integer variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −
Show Examples

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)


The Relational Operators
There are following relational operators supported by Java language.
Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then −
Show Examples

== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)

The Logical Operators
The following table lists the logical operators −
Assume Boolean variables A holds true and variable B holds false, then −
Show Examples

&& (logical and)
|| (logical or)
! (logical not)


The Assignment Operators
Following are the assignment operators supported by Java language −
Show Examples

= (assignment operator)
+= (add and assignment operator)
-= (subtract and assignment operator)
*= (multiply and assignment operator)
/= (divide and assignment operator)
%= (modulus and assignment operator)
