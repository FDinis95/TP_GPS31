Loop Control

There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages 

Java programming language provides the following types of loop to handle looping requirements:

while loop - repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true.

for loop - execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abreviates the code that manages the loop variable (i).

do...while loop - similar to the while statement, except it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

Java supports the following control statements

break statement - terminates the loop or switch statement and returns.

continue statement - causes the loop to skip the rest of the code and test the condition again.
